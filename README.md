- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @anhthumaii
- I am an ambitious and diligent individual
- with a passion for Embedded systems and Microelectronics.
- I am currently a double-degree final-year engineering student
- pursuing Computer Science and Electronics for Embedded systems
- at Polytech, Grenoble INP-UGA and Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT).
- I will take advantage of my youth to embark on and dig deep into this field
- so I will engage in a 6-month internship starting mid-March 2024 focusing signal integrity and analog design validation.
- Furthermore, I will move forward with an in-depth CIFRE PhD subject starting early September 2024 peering into
- embedded systems and chip development.
